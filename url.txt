A public git repository with your project code: https://github.com/robertrama/cdond-c3-projectstarter

S3 Bucket: http://udapeople-02f7258.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html

Cloudfront URL: http://d1n4zybogzpesn.cloudfront.net/#/employees
(Basically the cloudfront works, it just has one problem. I managed to add the employees but when I try to use the 
cloudfront link it immediately sends me to the url of s3 bucket but it uses the HTTPS protocol so it doesn't work. 
But if you try to use HTTP it works.)
